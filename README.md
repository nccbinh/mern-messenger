# Express Starter

This starter repo will be used for building applications using React, Material-UI, React-Router, Node, & Express.js.

## Getting started

The project is broken down into a client and server folder. 
MERN (MongoDB - Express.js - React.js - Node.js) stack is used throughout the project.

### Setting Up MongoDB

> MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era. 
*- mongodb.com*

To download and install MongoDB locally, simply visit their [download page](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community), select your platform and start downloading.
Installing it is even more simple, just follow on-screen instructions and proceed with the default full installation (which will install MongoDB as a service).

Optionally, a GUI tool to manage your MongoDB data can be downloaded [here](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass).
